# RGB Color Value Guessing Game

An RGB guessing game web application, made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I developed this application as an easy and fun way to learn the different RGB values and their associated colors, while learning JavaScript along the way. I have hosted the application and the link can be found [here](https://whatsthatcolor.netlify.app/) or below.

## How To Play

The game is very simple to play. Upon launching the web app, the header will display a unique and randomized RGB code which represents a color. The order of the numbers is the amount of red, green, and blue in the color. Refreshing the page or clicking the `new colors` button will prompt a new RGB code as well as a new set of colorful squares. The goal is to select the proper square which is the color being shown in the RGB code. Users can toggle between easy mode and hard mode, the difference being the number of squares present to guess from. The game is fun, interactive, and has everything completely randomized.
